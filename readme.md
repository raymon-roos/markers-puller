# How to use?

**Tools:**

If you have many collections, i would reccomend another repo of mine that allows you to record your mouse and keyboard events and play them back.
this would allow you to just go once to a collection and record the process and then just switch from collection and run the process again.

##

**if you need to install the libraries:**

```pip install json os re requests urllib```

##

**Step 0:**

Download the code from this repo.

##

**Step 1:**

Open your Markers and log in.
Go to one of your collections at a time.

##

**Step 2:**

Go to inspect element.

##

**Step 3:**

Go to the network tab in the element inspector.
This is sometimes in the lint:

But can also be in a hamburger menu like this:

##

**Step 4:**

Refresh the Markers page with the network tab open.
If it went well, you would see something like this in the network tab:

##

**Step 5:**

We are searching for a specific part in here and we can easily find it by sorting things on time by clicking 2 times on the time part in the network tab so there is a downwards arrow next to "time":

after:

##

**Step 6:**

Click on the part that i probably at the top because it took long to load and if not, its name starts with "evaluation" and has an orange ";" in front of it:

before:

after:

##

**Step 7:**

Copy this part:

![alt text](assets/copy_api_url.png)

and place it in a new browser tab as the url:

![alt text](assets/place_url_in_new_tab.png)

and hit enter.

If done correctly, the page will load for probably a few seconds and then show something like this after we click "pretty-print":

![alt text](assets/api_result.png)

##

**Step 8:**

Copy all the text in that browser window and save it in a JSON file next to the python code from this repo as "markers.json":

##

**Step 9:**

If you now run the puthon code, there should appear an output directory next to the python code with everything you uploaded to Markers.
